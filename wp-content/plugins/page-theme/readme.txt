Specify the theme (not template, that is already taken care of by Wordpress) you wish to use with each given page or blog post.

== Description ==

* Keep updated! http://nexus.zteo.com/
* This plugin can be used to display a different theme for each page of your blog.
* This plugin can be used to display a different theme for each one of your blog posts.
* The interface used to configure this is very user-friendly. Even friendlier since v1.3.
* Many thanks to Stephen Carroll whose domain page's script motivated me to write this plugin.
* Thanks also go to emposha.com for their image selection script, which I shamelessly hacked and surely made worse.

== Installation ==

1. Expand this plugin's archive content to wp-content/plugins/
2. Go to Administration > Plugins and activate this plugin.
3. Activate page or posts integration, or both, at ACP > Appearance > Page Theme
4a. You can now configure your pages themes at ACP > Pages > Pages
4b. You can now configure your posts themes at ACP > Posts > Posts

== Limitations ==

* Due to Wordpress selecting themes and stylesheets very early on when building a page, I cannot use Wordpress' "official" way to detect the current page/post. Therefore, you may find that this plugin does not work correcly if your setup is extremely exotic. Contact me if this happens.
